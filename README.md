ScienSolar package v. 1.51 (2024) for modeling physics and mathematics in MS Excel (tested on MS Excel 2013-2019 for Windows and Mac).

COPYRIGHT AND CONDITIONS OF USE: 
The package is distributed under licensing provisions GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3. Author of the main package: PhD Ariel R. Becerra B., 2022.
For modeling, you do not need to program in VBA, it is enough with the Excel functions.

INSTALATION:

The package is distributed in 8 text files and must be integrated into an Excel file. The content of the files is as follows:


	1. 1_5MODULE_1.TXT - main code for ScienSolar to work properly.
	2. 1_5MODULE_2.txt - main code 2 for ScienSolar to work properly
	3. 1_5MODULE_3.txt - Models as samples. 
	4. 1_5MODULE_4.txt - Models as samples. 
	5. 1_5MODULE_5.txt - Models as samples. 
	6. 1_5MODULE_6.txt - Models as samples. 
 	7. 1_51MODULE_7.txt - Derivative pack module
	8. 1_51MODULE_8.txt - Models as samples.
	
 TO MAKE IT WORK:
 1. Open a New MS Excel file, open the VBA Editor (Alt + F11 in Windows or Fn + Option + F11 in macOS).
 2. In the VBAProject insert modules. Add 6 modules.
 3. Copy and paste all the ScienSolar package code into the modules (the content of each file into a different module).
 4. In MS Excel, in a new spreadsheet, go to the DEVELOPER tab and in the Controls group, click Insert a Button. If DEVELOPER tab is not activated, activate it in MS Excel settings.
 5. Click a location on the worksheet to place the button.
 6. Assign the NewSheet macro to the button.
 7. Click the button to generate the ScienSolar interface.
 8. To load a sample project, select it from the list and click the +Vector button.
 9. To add objects to projects (such as Excel 3D models, equations, etc.) place them into a new sheet named 3DModels
     (to download the objects file for some example projects go to https://sciensolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3DModels.xlsx and
    open the file, then move the 3DModels sheet to the workbook where the code is installed. Another option is to copy the code to the 3DModels file.)
 10. Save the file in your desired folder, save it as Macro-Enabled Workbook (*. xlsm).
 11. Visit www.sciensolar.com to download updates and documentation.
